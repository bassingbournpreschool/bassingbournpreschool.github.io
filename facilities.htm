<p>We are housed in a purpose-built centre next to both the Primary School and Village College.  Not only is this very convenient for parents dropping off or picking up older children, but it makes us part of the educational hub of the village.  The building was constructed in 2010 and consists of two large rooms which can be divided or left separate, giving us maximum flexibility when the children are there.   There is a small kitchen for preparing food for snack-time, and a generous garden with both grass and hard play spaces, as well as a large flowerbed and a climbing frame.  We have ample space for both adult-led and independent activities for the children.</p>
<p>The outside area is completely secure, and fenced off with railings covered with newly purchased wicker screens to preserve a natural feel to the garden. The children have easy and frequent access to outside, especially in the summer. </p>

<p>When the children arrive at Pre-School each morning they can hang their coats and bags on their pegs in the main corridor before going to their rooms, keeping them out of the way of their playing space.  Although we frequently allow children to mix between the two rooms, in general Room 1 is home to the children who are three and under, and Room 2 the children who will progress on to primary school the following year.</p>

<p>We have an extensive collection of toys, including small world playthings, play food and cooking equipment, dressing up clothes, puzzles, letter and number toys and games, outdoor toys and ride-ons, water tables and sand trays. We always appreciate donations of good quality pre-loved toys so if you have something you think we could make use of, please ask!  We also have a large collection of arts and crafts materials and paper and paint which the children love to make use of.</p>
<p>There are a number of toilets for the use of the children, as well as a changing space for those children as yet not toilet-trained.  </p>
<p>Our rooms have high ceilings, plenty of light, and plenty of space, and are practical, clean, safe rooms ideal for the children who come to Pre-School.
