<p><b>“Children develop in the context of relationships and the environment around them”</b><em> (Development Matters in the Early Years Foundation Stage)</em></p>
<p>At Bassingbourn Pre-School we strive to encourage and enable the development of independence.  We believe this plays a large part in making the transition into full-time school as stress-free as possible for the children. The way the setting is laid out and the activities available are planned with this in mind. </p>
<p>The characteristics of effective learning are playing and exploring, active learning and creating and thinking critically, and we aim to provide an environment where children are motivated to explore and develop their own ideas while progressing through the Early Years Foundation Stage. Our key person system enables us to ensure that each child is supported in developing their full potential at their own pace.</p>

<p>The three primary areas of the EYFS are as follows:</p>

<h3>Communication and Language</h3>
<p>Providing a rich language environment helps children develop the confidence to express themselves and to speak and listen in a range of situations.</p>

<h3>Personal Social and Emotional</h3>
<p>Modelling consideration, appropriate behaviour and respect and concern for others helps children to develop social skills and manage their feelings.</p>

<h3>Physical</h3>
<p>Providing opportunities for children to be active and to develop independence in self-care helps them begin to understand the importance of physical activity and healthy choices. </p>

</div>

<p>It is these three areas that we focus on with those children in Room 1.  Then, as they progress through Pre-School and into Room 2, we begin to cover the other aspects of the EYFS: literacy, mathematics, and understanding the world.  The EYFS continues throughout your child's first year at Primary School as well.</p>

<p>The key people are responsible for assessing the progress of the children in their care.  They keep and maintain scrapbooks and written records which document each child's individual progress in the various areas of the EYFS.  These are discussed with parents at parents' evenings and can be seen by parents at any time should they wish to do so.  These records are passed on to the Primary School before the children start their first year in order to help them provide continuity of approach and care.</p>

<p>The main focus of Pre-School is learning through play.  Children develop fundamental skills through experimenting with and manipulating paints, water, sand, toys, puzzles and outdoor equipment.  They learn to communicate and work together through early parallel and then eventually co-operative play with one another.  They learn about risk and safety through climbing on apparatus and chasing each other.  They learn language by singing songs, listening to stories and playing games.   Our children enjoy their time at Pre-School and, supported by their Key Person, they develop skills at their own pace and based on their own interests.
