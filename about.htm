<p>Bassingbourn Pre-School is a registered charity (no: 1026490)  and a member of the Pre-School Learning Alliance. We are run by a management committee made up of a group of Parent/Carers elected each year at our Annual General Meeting.</p>

<p>Since 2010 we have been housed in a modern building between the Village College and Primary Schools on Brook Road.  We have the left-hand half of the building, and are neighbours to the Stepping Stones Children's Centre.  We have two rooms: children in Room 1, the 'Explorers', are aged two to three years, and in Room 2 the 'Inventors' are children from three to four years in the year before they start school.</p>

<p>The Pre-School operates during term time only, following the standard Cambridgeshire term dates, and takes children from the age of two. We can have up to twenty children in the Inventors room (Room 1) and twelve in the Explorers room (Room 2) at any one session. We operate on a staff ratio of 1:4 for two year olds and 1:6 for three and four year olds.</p>

<p><b>Our Aims and Objectives</b></p>

<p>Bassingbourn Pre-School recognises that the education of very young children is about feelings and relationships as well as exploring and experimenting. We aim to provide a happy and nurturing environment where all the children feel safe and are able to develop self esteem and independence. We work within the Early Years Foundation Stage framework and use the information we gain about individual children from observation, interaction and discussion with Parents/Carers to ensure we provide activities that will engage each child and best support their learning journey.
